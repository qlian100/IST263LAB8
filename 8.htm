CSS positioning: not a replacement for flex or float - is a way to dictate how element interact with each other and page around them

CSS position properties:

5 of positioning:

 1. position: static - ANTI  position the same as everything we have done to this point."turning positioning off"

 2. position: relative - the ability to move an object based upon where is exists naturally on the page.
 	
 	when you move a position: relative object, the space where it comes from is perpetually reserved for that object - SO DO NOT DO THIS

 3. position: absolute -  disassociates the element from the page entirely, and allows it to move on the page without regrad to where other elements are 

 	BUT.. it moves in a relationship to the nearest parent position: relative element

 	ONLY USE THIS THEN YOU WANT TO PUT THINGS ON TOP OF OTHER THINGS!!.

 4. position: fixed -  attaches an element to a specific location on the page, and it can not move, regardless of scrolling.

 5. position: sticky - similar to position fixed, except that it only becomes fixed in specific situation.



	Five CSS properties that only exist when positioning (not static) turned on 


	(form the)top:
	(form the)bottom: 
	(form the)left:
	(form the)right:



	top OR bottom
